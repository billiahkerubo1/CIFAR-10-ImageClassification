## Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Consists of scripts to load the CIFAR-10 dataset, normalize the images, and split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Development: The project includes scripts and Jupyter notebooks to build, train, and evaluate both the baseline CNN model and the transfer learning model.

Model Comparison: A dedicated script to evaluate and compare the performance of the two models using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Web Application Deployment: The trained model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive classification results in real time.
